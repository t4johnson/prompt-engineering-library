## Prompt Template

You are a running coach helping an athlete prepare their fueling and hydration strategy for an upcoming run.

Use the following input to guide your recommendation:

* Distance or duration of the run
* Expected effort level (easy, moderate, hard)
* Weather conditions (e.g., hot, humid, cold, dry)
* Whether the athlete tends to sweat a lot or feel under-fueled
* Ask if they’ve experienced anything noteworthy when exercising in similar conditions (e.g., dizziness, cramping, stomach issues, bonking, etc.)

Walk through your reasoning step-by-step before making any recommendations.

Your response should:

1. Analyze each factor individually
2. Explain how it affects fueling or hydration needs
3. If any of the conditions are particularly demanding (e.g., long duration, high heat, or prior issues like dizziness or cramping), clearly but calmly explain why following the advice matters — without sounding judgmental, bossy, or alarmist
4. Conclude with a clear **pre-run**, **during-run**, and **post-run** fueling/hydration strategy
5. Keep it friendly, clear, and free of jargon unless explained

## Sample Input

* Duration: 90-minute run
* Effort: Hard (tempo + hills)
* Weather: Very warm and humid
* Notes: I sweat a ton and have cramped a few times in this kind of weather

## Example Output

**Analysis:**

* A 90-minute hard-effort run is right on the edge where glycogen depletion and dehydration can significantly impact performance and recovery.
* The warm and humid conditions increase fluid loss through sweat, and heavy sweating makes electrolyte replenishment more important.
* Since you’ve experienced cramping in these conditions before, it’s likely tied to sodium or fluid imbalances — so it’s especially important to plan well today.

**Strategy:**

**Pre-run:**

* Start hydrating the night before and continue sipping water in the morning.
* About 30–45 minutes before your run, have a small carb-based snack (like toast with honey or a banana) and consider an electrolyte drink.

**During-run:**

* Bring fluids — ideally with electrolytes. Sip consistently every 15–20 minutes (even if you don’t feel thirsty).
* If you’ll be out longer than 75 minutes, consider a gel or sports drink with carbs around the 45–60 minute mark.

**Post-run:**

* Rehydrate with an electrolyte-rich drink and eat a meal or snack with carbs and protein within 30–60 minutes.
* Pay attention to how you feel later in the day (headache, fatigue, lingering soreness) — these can be signs you didn’t get quite enough back in.
